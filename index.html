            <p>
                My name is Helen J and I major in Computer Science. I love playing video games. My favorite game is Splatoon. 
                I started playing Splatoon2 when it first came out in 2017, and I am still playing this game. Over the summer, 
                I took two summer courses so I was busy all summer and never really got some time to rest. When I graduate, 
                I am hoping to be able to find a job in software development on the west coast, and live together with a dog and a cat.
